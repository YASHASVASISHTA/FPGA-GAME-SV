2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net VGA/vga_sync_unit/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin VGA/vga_sync_unit/h_count_reg[9]_i_1/O, cell VGA/vga_sync_unit/h_count_reg[9]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cell1/State_reg[1]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cell1/State_reg[1]_i_1/O, cell cell1/State_reg[1]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cell2/State_reg[1]_i_1__0_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cell2/State_reg[1]_i_1__0/O, cell cell2/State_reg[1]_i_1__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cell3/State_reg[1]_i_1__1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cell3/State_reg[1]_i_1__1/O, cell cell3/State_reg[1]_i_1__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cell4/State_reg[1]_i_1__2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cell4/State_reg[1]_i_1__2/O, cell cell4/State_reg[1]_i_1__2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cell5/State_reg[1]_i_1__3_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cell5/State_reg[1]_i_1__3/O, cell cell5/State_reg[1]_i_1__3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cell6/State_reg[1]_i_1__4_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cell6/State_reg[1]_i_1__4/O, cell cell6/State_reg[1]_i_1__4. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cell7/State_reg[1]_i_1__5_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cell7/State_reg[1]_i_1__5/O, cell cell7/State_reg[1]_i_1__5. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cell8/State_reg[1]_i_1__6_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cell8/State_reg[1]_i_1__6/O, cell cell8/State_reg[1]_i_1__6. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#10 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cell9/State_reg[1]_i_1__7_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cell9/State_reg[1]_i_1__7/O, cell cell9/State_reg[1]_i_1__7. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT VGA/vga_sync_unit/h_count_reg[9]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 6 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    VGA/pDisp_reg[0]_lopt_replica_3 {FDRE}
    VGA/pDisp_reg[0]_lopt_replica_4 {FDRE}
    VGA/pDisp_reg[0]_lopt_replica_2 {FDRE}
    VGA/pDisp_reg[0]_lopt_replica {FDRE}
    VGA/pDisp_reg[1] {FDRE}
